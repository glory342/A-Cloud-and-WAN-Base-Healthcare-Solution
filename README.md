A Cloud Saver in the context of Wide Area Networks (WAN) is a cloud-based solution that helps organizations efficiently store, back up, and transfer data across remote offices. By leveraging cloud services, it reduces the need for expensive local storage, optimizes bandwidth usage, and ensures secure off-site backup of critical information. Cloud Savers are often integrated with WAN optimization technologies to improve performance and reliability. Examples include Microsoft Azure Backup, which stores server backups in the cloud; AWS S3 with Direct Connect, which accelerates data transfer; and Veeam Cloud Backup, which performs incremental cloud backups to save bandwidth and storage costs. These solutions enable organizations to maintain seamless access to data while minimizing costs and network congestion

# A CLOUD AND WAN-BASED HEALTHCARE SOLUTION

 Importance, Description of Cloud Services and WAN, and System Overview)

4. Importance and Justification of the Project

The health industry plays a fundamental role in the well-being and development of a community. However, in the majority of regions like Yaoundé and other parts of Cameroon, the health industry still encounters poor management of information, communication disconnection, and poor digital infrastructure. These disconnections lead to inefficiency, high costs of operation, and poor patient satisfaction.

Implementing a Cloud and WAN-Based Healthcare Solution is one of the digital transformation steps that can potentially solve these problems. The justification for this project can be explained as follows:

4.1. Data Security and Accessibility

Cloud computing allows hospitals to store patient information safely on distant servers. Data is encrypted and stored back-up copies, reducing the risk of loss or corruption of data. Authorized doctors have access to data at any time using secure log-in mechanisms.

4.2. Real-Time Communication and Coordination

With WAN (Wide Area Network), clinics and hospitals in other regions may instantly share information. This enables faster referrals, easy access to laboratory findings, and greater cooperation among medical professionals.

4.3. Reduced Cost and Maintenance

Traditional healthcare systems employ physical servers which require technical specialists and maintenance. Cloud computing eliminates this as everything can be accessed on-line, reducing costs for smaller clinics.

4.4. Greater Decision-Making

With all the patient data collected and made available, doctors can make faster and improved decisions. The system can also be provisioned with basic analytics to monitor patient trends and hospital performance.

4.5. Patient Accessibility

Patients can easily access their record, book appointments, and even interact with their doctors anywhere, most easily via mobile phones or computers with internet access.

This project is worth it because it offers an inexpensive and environmentally friendly way of upgrading healthcare systems to date without requiring investments in expensive hardware.

5. Description of Cloud Services

5.1. What is a Cloud Service?

Cloud service is a web-based system that allows users to store, process, and manage data without physical servers. Instead of storing data on local machines, cloud services store it on remote servers that are available online at any time.

Cloud services are mainly divided into three categories:
	• IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) Provides virtual hardware and storage capacity (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud).
•	PaaS (Platform as a Service) Offers platforms for application deployment and development (e.g., Microsoft Azure).
	•	SaaS (Software as a Service): Offers ready-made applications via the internet (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, Zoom).

5.2. Example in Use

Hospitals across the globe can make use of cloud platforms like Google Cloud Healthcare API and Microsoft Azure Health Data Services to maintain patient records and offer remote consultations.
In our case, the project can make use of Google Cloud to save information securely and allow easy access for doctors and patient

6. Description of WAN (Wide Area Network)

6.1. What is WAN?

A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a telecommunication network that covers large geographical areas, interconnecting multiple local networks. In the field of medicine, WAN allows hospitals, laboratories, and clinics in different parts of a city or even in distant towns to exchange data and communicate with each other through an encrypted network.

For example, a patient who has done an X-ray at one clinic within Yaoundé has his/her results immediately viewed by a doctor at another hospital in Douala using WAN connectivity. 

6.2. Importance of WAN in Healthcare
	•	It allows instant sharing of medical test reports and patient history.
	•	It allows various hospitals to collaborate with ease.
	•	It facilitates telemedicine, allowing patients to be consulted by doctors online.
• It provides redundancy and backup, and thus data is always available even if one network is unavailable.

7. System Overview

The Cloud and WAN-Based Healthcare System is a hub-and-spoke system that connects hospitals, labs, and patients through a protected cloud network based on WAN connectivity.

How it Works
	1. Patient Registration: Patients are registered with their individual details through a web or mobile interface. Their details are securely stored in the cloud.
2. Doctor Access: Physicians login to see medical records, past consultations, and lab results.
3. Hospital Collaboration: Various hospitals and labs linked through WAN are able to share information in real time.
4. Cloud Storage: All data is kept in an encrypted manner on the cloud to keep unauthorized individuals out.
5. Remote Access: Patients are able to see their reports, prescriptions, and appointments online.
6. Updates and Notifications: Real-time alerts regarding appointments, lab results, and prescriptions are sent by the system.
The solution is architected to provide a single, cohesive healthcare platform that consolidates all the major stakeholders — from doctors to patients — and improves overall healthcare quality delivery.A-Cloud-and-WAN-Base-Healthcare-Solution
